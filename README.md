# Approval Workflows with AnnounceBot


> :sparkles: *Updated August 2018: As we have introduced the workspace app (currently in beta), this tutorial and the code samples have been updated using the new token model! All the changes from the previous version of this example, read the [diff.md](diff.md)*

*Learn more about the workspace app at the [Slack API doc](https://api.slack.com/workspace-apps-preview).*

This app will send announcements into a channel of your choice. Users can DM this app to get their announcements into a review queue. Once the approver gives the thumbs up, the announcement will be posted to public.

User A ("girlie_mac") wants to announce about donuts on `#random` channel, and User B ("Slack Boss") approves it:
